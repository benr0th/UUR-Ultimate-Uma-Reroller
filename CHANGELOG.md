# Changelog

## v0.9.1

- Changed amount of times to move banner since some were added

## v0.9.0

- Added roll rarity detection and Kitasan Black detection
- You can now set a threshold for the amount of target SSRs that must obtained to Data Link an account
  - Any accounts that ***do not*** meet the threshold ***will not be saved***
  (This means that even if you got a bunch of SSRs but didn't get enough of the target SSR, it will not be saved! A more flexible method is planned for the future.)
  - You can set the threshold to 0 to save all accounts
- Trainer IDs are now saved to a text file, showing how many of the target SSR was obtained for that account
